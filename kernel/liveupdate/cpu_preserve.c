 * DOC: Preserved CPU Subsystem
 *
 * Live Update allows updating the host kernel while preserving the state of
 * hardware resources across the transition. While memfd-based memory
 * preservation is supported via LUO and PCI device preservation is handled
 * by VFIO and IOMMU, physical CPU cores represent another fundamental class
 * of hardware resource that requires preservation.
 *
 * A primary motivation is preserving virtual machine (VM) workloads across
 * host kernel updates without pausing the guest. By separating a physical
 * core from standard host scheduling and keeping it active across the kexec
 * reboot, guest vCPUs or dedicated bare-metal tasks can continue
 * uninterrupted execution on-core.
 *
 * This subsystem provides the generic, hypervisor-agnostic foundation for
 * physical CPU preservation.
 *

 *
 * File Descriptor Binding
 * =======================
 *
 * 1. **Sysfs control file:** Each hotpluggable CPU exports a read-only sysfs
 *    attribute at ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<N>/preserve``. The file
 *    descriptor of this file handles the lifecycle of the preserved CPU.
 *
 * 2. **Preservation via LUO:** Userspace opens this file and registers the fd
 *    with LUO. Preserving the file offlines the core from host scheduling,
 *    migrates its interrupts and tasks, and transitions the CPU from online
 *    into the parked state (cpu_preserved_park()). Preservation integrates with
 *    the On-Core framework (oncore_session_add_cpu()).
 *
 * 3. **KHO and memory preservation:** The parking loop, dedicated preserved
 *    CPU stacks, runtime execution buffers outside Scratch memory, and
 *    preserved CPU state reside in memory preserved across kexec via KHO.
 *
 * 4. **Incoming boot:** During early boot, the incoming kernel restores the
 *    preserved CPU mask from the KHO FLB before secondary SMP bringup and
 *    skips bringing preserved cores online, maintaining isolation.
 *
 * 5. **Retrieval and unpreservation:** When userspace retrieves the session in
 *    the incoming kernel, it receives the open ``preserve`` file descriptor.
 *    Retrieving the session reconnects the descriptors and restores on-core session
 *    state while keeping the core running. Finalizing the session (``finish``)
 *    or closing the fd unpreserves the CPU, signaling the core to exit the
 *    parking loop and automatically restoring it online via add_cpu().
 *
 * Architecture Requirements
 * =========================
 *
 * In addition to CPU hotplug (``CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU``), an architecture
 * selecting ``ARCH_SUPPORTS_LIVEUPDATE_CPU`` must provide:
 *
 * - **Linker script:** Include ``CPU_PRESERVED_TEXT`` in
 *   ``arch/<arch>/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S`` within the executable text section.
 *
 * - **Preserved text section:** Functions executed by a parked core or during
 *   live update transitions must be annotated with ``__cpu_preserved_text`` so
 *   their instructions reside in the KHO-preserved ``.text.cpu_preserved``
 *   section. These are the ``arch_cpu_preserved_*()`` hooks documented in
 *   ``include/linux/cpu_preserve.h``.
 *
 * - **Address-space mapping hooks:** arch_cpu_preserved_as_map(),
 *   arch_cpu_preserved_as_flush_tlb(), and
 *   arch_cpu_preserved_set_transition_as() populate and manage isolated page
 *   tables built by the core layer using cpu_preserved_as_alloc_page().
 *
 * - **Buffer relocation hook:** arch_cpu_preserved_setup_buffer() relocates
 *   preserved text and data sections outside KHO Scratch memory so the
 *   incoming kernel can unpack safely.
 *
 * - **CPU hotplug and stop-IPI isolation:** Exclude preserved CPUs from stop
 *   signals (NMI or stop IPIs in the machine reboot and crash paths), and
 *   avoid tearing down local interrupt controllers (LAPIC, GIC CPU interface)
 *   during CPU disable when the core is being preserved.
 *
 * Isolated Address Space
 * ======================
 *
 * A preserved core does not run on the kernel's own page tables. Before it is
 * handed over, the core layer builds a transition page table
 * (cpu_preserved_as_create()) containing only what on-core execution needs,
 * so that a core still running a workload cannot touch memory the new kernel
 * has taken ownership of:
 *
 * - Preserved text and read-only data, ``PAGE_KERNEL_ROX``
 *   (``__cpu_preserved_text``) -- park loops, world-switch routines, ops
 *   vector tables, and exception stubs;
 * - Preserved writable globals, ``PAGE_KERNEL`` NX
 *   (``__cpu_preserved_data``) -- state machines, session descriptors,
 *   per-CPU control blocks, and the preserved-CPU masks;
 * - The per-CPU dedicated preserved stack, ``PAGE_KERNEL`` NX;
 * - The KHO-preserved workload state pages, ``PAGE_KERNEL`` NX;
 * - Hardware control MMIO, ``PAGE_KERNEL_IO``, only where the interrupt
 *   controller still requires it (e.g., GICv3 in system-register mode needs
 *   none).
 *
 * Deliberately absent: the linear direct map, all user address ranges, the
 * kernel heap, vmalloc, modules, and BPF JIT. Guest memory is not mapped
 * either -- it is reached through stage-2 translation.
 *
 * On arm64 these mappings are built with trans_pgd_map_range(), on x86 with
 * the identity-map helpers in ``arch/x86/mm/ident_map.c``. Custom workload
 * address spaces can also be created and adopted across kexec via
 * cpu_preserved_as_adopt().
 *
 * Workload Integration
 * ====================
 *
 * Physical cores preserved across live update execute payloads managed by the
 * On-Core execution framework. CPU preservation integrates directly with On-Core
 * session lifecycle:
 *
 * - On-Core assigns jobs to preserved cores via cpu_preserved_attach_workload().
 * - When a CPU file is preserved or unpreserved, oncore_session_add_cpu() and
 *   oncore_session_remove_cpu() update the session CPU bitmap.
 * - At kexec handover, oncore_session_get_ser() serializes the session state into
 *   the preserved CPU file descriptor, and oncore_session_restore() reconstructs
 *   the session in the incoming kernel.
