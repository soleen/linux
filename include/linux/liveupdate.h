/**
 * enum liveupdate_event - Events that trigger live update callbacks.
 * @LIVEUPDATE_PREPARE: PREPARE should happens *before* the blackout window.
 *                      Subsystems should prepare for an upcoming reboot by
 *                      serializing their states. However, it must be considered
 *                      that user applications, e.g. virtual machines are still
 *                      running during this phase.
 * @LIVEUPDATE_FREEZE:  FREEZE sent from the reboot() syscall, when the current
 *                      kernel is on its way out. This is the final opportunity
 *                      for subsystems to save any state that must persist
 *                      across the reboot. Callbacks for this event should be as
 *                      fast as possible since they are on the critical path of
 *                      rebooting into the next kernel.
 * @LIVEUPDATE_FINISH:  FINISH is sent in the newly booted kernel after a
 *                      successful live update and normally *after* the blackout
 *                      window. Subsystems should perform any final cleanup
 *                      during this phase. This phase also provides an
 *                      opportunity to clean up devices that were preserved but
 *                      never explicitly reclaimed during the live update
 *                      process. State restoration should have already occurred
 *                      before this event. Callbacks for this event must not
 *                      fail. The completion of this call transitions the
 *                      machine from ``updated`` to ``normal`` state.
 * @LIVEUPDATE_CANCEL:  CANCEL the live update and go back to normal state. This
 *                      event is user initiated, or is done automatically when
 *                      LIVEUPDATE_PREPARE or LIVEUPDATE_FREEZE stage fails.
 *                      Subsystems should revert any actions taken during the
 *                      corresponding prepare event. Callbacks for this event
 *                      must not fail.
 *
 * These events represent the different stages and actions within the live
 * update process that subsystems (like device drivers and bus drivers)
 * need to be aware of to correctly serialize and restore their state.

 *                                   LIVEUPDATE_PREPARE callbacks have completed
 *                                   successfully.

 *                                   (%LIVEUPDATE_FREEZE) has been sent, and the
 *                                   system is performing its final state saving

 *                                   imminent.
 * @LIVEUPDATE_STATE_UPDATED:        The system has rebooted into the next
 *                                   kernel via live update the system is now
 *                                   running the next kernel, awaiting the
 *                                   finish event.
